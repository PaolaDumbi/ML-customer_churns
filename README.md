# ML-customer_churns

This project involves the initial phases of customer churn analysis, specifically data cleaning and exploration. The objective is to prepare and understand the dataset, setting the foundation for subsequent analysis and modeling.

Key Components:

1. Data Preparation and Analysis:
   
Collected raw data on customer demographics, usage patterns, transaction history, and customer service interactions. Cleaned the data rigorously to address missing values, outliers, and ensure integrity. Performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations and statistical analyses to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends, gaining insights into potential factors contributing to customer churn.

2. Next Steps:
   
- Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve model predictions, including transformations, combinations, and time-based features.
  
- Model Development: Build machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) for predicting customer churn.
  
- Model Interpretation: Analyze model results to understand which features are most important for predicting churn, informing retention strategies.
  
- Implementation and Deployment: Integrate the developed model into a user-friendly system, potentially including a dashboard for real-time monitoring.
  
- Recommendations and Actionable Insights: Provide actionable recommendations (e.g., personalized marketing, targeted promotions, improved customer service) based on the analysis to reduce churn rates.

3. Technologies Used:
   
-Python (Pandas, NumPy)
-Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-Upcoming: Machine learning libraries (Scikit-learn)
-Future: Dashboarding tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for visualization and presentation

4. Outcome (Current):
   
The completed data cleaning and exploration phases have laid the groundwork for a robust analysis, providing a clean and well-understood dataset for subsequent modeling and analysis.This project involves the initial phases of customer churn analysis, specifically data cleaning and exploration. The objective is to prepare and understand the dataset, setting the foundation for subsequent analysis and modeling.
